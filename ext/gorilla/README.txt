Gorilla Audio is an attempt to make a free, straightforward, cross-platform, high-level software audio mixer that supports playback of both static and streaming sounds. It is intended for video game development, but should easily support many other real-time audio software applications.

The library is written in ANSI C, and is licensed under the MIT license. It was written by Tim Ambrogi, engine programmer at Final Form Games.

Gorilla Audio code includes some other libraries that are licensed under terms other than MIT. This includes code under the Xiph and LGPL licenses. Non-MIT code in the repository is denoted by COPYING files.
